During a transaction, there is an absence of a mechanism to ensure seller owns the products being sold. This application uses the power of Blockchain and smart contracts to solve this problem with the help of a ownership mechanism system. This project performs a series of functionalities like:
* Providing decentralised payment service to users
* Using RSK network to utilise both EVM compatibility and security of Bitcoin
* Mechanism to ensure ownership of seller
* QR code functionality for easy and user friendly transactions
